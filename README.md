# Coordshare
Coordshare is an interactive website where users can upload their own landmarks to a world map. It was coded in 15 weeks as my solo Capstone project at Brookdale Community College. HTML, CSS, and Javascript were used for the front-end, NodeJS was used for the server, and MySQL was used for the user database.
